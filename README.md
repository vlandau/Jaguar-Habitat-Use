### Integrating Presence-only and Occupancy Data to Model Habitat Use for the Northernmost Population of Jaguars
This repository contains data and code to model habitat use for the northernmost population of jaguars. This work is currently in review with _Ecological Applications_, and this repository will be updated upon acceptance and publication of the manuscript.

This repository contains two directories: code, and data. The code directory contains the code needed to reproduce the analysis, including covariate derivation, the MCMC sampler, and code to fit and validate the models. The data directory contains the publicly available jaguar presence data used for this anaylsis in CSV format. The occupancy data are not being made publicly available due to the endangered status of the jaguar, but access can be requested from [Clayton Nielson](https://zoology.siu.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/adjunct-faculty/nielsen-c.php).

All of the data required for covariate generation are available in the Google Earth Engine data catalog, and the code to derive covariates is available in the code directory in this repository.
